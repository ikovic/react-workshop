## React Workshop @SeekandHit
 TODO:
 - Google Maps API key
 - Google Maps package: map + markers, see how to place markers on positions
 - Main layout 
 - App holds state, renders Map and MarkersList
 - MarkersList takes an array of markers and renders a list of MarkerItems
 - MarkerItem allows for deletion of a marker
 - delete function is passed down the component tree

 ## Project setup

 Clone the repo and run `npm install`. `eslint` and `prettier` configuration files are included,
 so your editor can pick that up. Project is bootstrapped with [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). `.env` file is used to set the environment 
 variables for us. `NODE_PATH=src/` variable is used so we can get rid of relative paths when importing
 JS modules [read this to be smarter](https://moduscreate.com/es6-es2015-import-no-relative-path-webpack/).
